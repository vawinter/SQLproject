## Our aim
The main goal of this project was to integrate a Microsoft Access database into R
using the **RODBC** package. While this appeared very straightforward,
we ran into several complex issues. Here, we document the problems, solutions we found, and
some results we were able to acomplish.

## What is an Access database?
### Microsoft Access
Access is a database management system using Microsoft’s Jet Database Engine
Databases are created and stored in a unique format, making them not readily accessible to everyone

### Getting Access data into R Introduction
There are two methods to connect with Access databases
1. Using the ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity) facility
2. Using the DBI (DataBase Interface) package in R
ODBC allows connection to a database to be opened
Then, SQL is needed to actually import database tables into R

### ODBC
ODBC allows access to a variety of database systems via a common interface
ODBC requires a specific driver to be installed (in our case, a Microsoft Access Driver which is already installed with the installation of Office) which serves as a translation layer between ODBC and the database system

## SQL Project Roadblocks
*Microsoft Access isn’t included in MS Office for macOS*
This means although you don’t need to have the microsoft access file opened to use in R, you won’t have the Microsoft Access Driver needed 

### Issue #1: Driver instillation 

First, you want to make sure you have the relevant ODBC driver installed

If you have Microsoft Access installed, the driver should already be installed together however you can also install the drivers separately

To install separately, you can find the 32 bit or 64 bit driver here: o <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=>

There are two ways that information about the ODBC driver and the location of the database system is provided to ODBC

First way is to provide all information from within R each time the connection to the database system is established

Alternatively, you can establish a DSN (Data Source Name) so that the DNS describes the connection and only the DSN needs to be provided each time a connection is made

If you want to do it the first method, you need to have the path to the database

EX. C:\Users\Lily\Desktop\SQL\Database.accdb

### 1. Go to control panel

### 2. Search ODBC data sources. Click on Set up ODBC data sources (either 32-bit or 64-bit depending on your version of Microsoft. In our case, we are using 64-bit)

### 3. Under User DSN, you will see a list of the User Data Sources. Click Add…

### 4. Click on Microsoft Access Driver(*.mdb, *.accdb). Click Finish
![](Picture4.png)

### 5. Name your Data Source Name (DSN) and add a description. Click OK
![](Picture5.png)

### 6. Now, under User DSN you should see your newly named DSN. Click OK.

### 7.For mac, the ODBC Administrator equivalent is found in Applications/Utilities (which I can’t show since I can’t get Access on Mac)

## To access and import Access Tables into R using ODBC:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Install RODBC package and load the library

install.packages("RODBC")

library(RODBC)

#Establish a connection, using the DSN name you assigned in the previous steps or by using the path of your database

con <- odbcConnect("SQL_Driver")

#To get the names of the tables in the Access database, you can use the sqlTables() function

#Adding the tableType = “TABLE” parameter will return just the table names.

sqlTables(con, tableType = "TABLE")$TABLE_NAME
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
